# Linkedin-job-analytics

In this project, I have scrapped the data from linkedin webpage using selenium. I have drawn the insights and built the dashboard. Then I have used natural language processing for extracting skills from job description. I have used clustering machine learning algorithm which categorizes the different job. 
I have made webpage using flask, html and css. when users search an skills, it will show all the available jobs for that skills.
